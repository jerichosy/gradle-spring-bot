## Interactions

Discord4J has full support for interactions. These example projects showcase how to easily create, manage, and respond to application commands (slash commands). More details on using interactions with D4J can be found in our docs.

## ‚úÖ Inviting Your Bot

Discord now requires an additional scope in the invite link for slash commands. Below is a template invite link that will allow the bot to be invited and support application commands. Replace `{CLIENT_ID_HERE}` with your bot's client ID, found on its developer application page.

`
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id={CLIENT_ID_HERE}&permissions=0&scope=bot%20applications.commands
`

This invite link allows inviting your bot to a server, and enabling application commands from your bot. This template link does not provide any additional permissions or scopes. To create a fully customized link, discord offers an invite link builder on the developer applications page (Click into your bot application, and navigate to the "OAuth2" page)

## üì¶ Dependency Managers
Each project is duplicated in Maven and Gradle to show how to import Discord4J into your project with the package manager of your choice.

## üìê Spring Boot

Discord4J is fully compatible with the Spring Boot framework, and a set of example projects are provided showcasing what is possible with Spring and Discord4J together; simplifying and/or removing boilerplate shown in the Discord4J-only projects.

## üßæ Logging

* [Logging Docs](https://docs.discord4j.com/logging/)

Discord4j utilizes the SLF4J logging API. In this set of example projects, a simple logback configuration is used to demonstrate basic logging to console.

## üå≥ Minecraft

Discord4J can be used for a Minecraft plugin, however special care should be taken to avoid blocking on the main thread and dealing with Minecraft's old Netty & Jackson requirements.
